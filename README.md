# Parkinson's Disease Detection from Voice Data

## Overview
This project involves detecting Parkinson's disease using voice recordings. By extracting key voice features from audio data, machine learning models were trained to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease. The final solution includes a user-friendly **Streamlit web application** for real-time analysis.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project was created from the following source:
[Voice Samples for Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Healthy Controls](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Voice_Samples_for_Patients_with_Parkinson_s_Disease_and_Healthy_Controls/23849127).

### Features Extracted

## Machine Learning Models Trained
The following machine learning models were trained on the dataset:

1. **Decision Tree Classifier**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
5. **Naive Bayes**
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier**
7. **XGBoost Classifier**

### Model Selection
After training and evaluating all models, the **XGBoost Classifier** was chosen due to its superior accuracy and ability to handle imbalanced datasets.

## Application Development
A **Streamlit** app was created to make the solution accessible and interactive. Users can:

1. **Upload an audio file** or **record their voice** directly.
2. Extract features from the provided audio data.
3. Use the trained model to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease.

### Features of the App
- Real-time audio recording and analysis.
- Display of extracted features for user insight.
